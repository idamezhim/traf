Tiny habits can compound into massive changes if you stay consistent.

Desires that are too big can overwhelm you and seem out of reach. If you want to move them within reach, make them smaller. Much smaller.

- Want to start saving money? Move $5 into your savings account.
- Want to read more? Start with one page before bed.
- Want to be fit? Start with 10 pushups today.

Small wins generate momentum. The more you generate, the more you achieve, and the more you achieve, the more you generate. Tiny habits can create massive results over time.

Remember that the opposite is also true. When you skip a habit, you’re more likely to skip the next one, and even more likely to skip the one after that.

If you’re having trouble with the small things, thinking big is a waste of time.

All great things have small beginnings.
